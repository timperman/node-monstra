This is a super simple demo for making `search-index` available in the browser

To run this demo- navigate to this directory and execute the following command:

`../../node_modules/browserify/bin/cmd.js main.js -o bundle.js`

You can then see the demo by opening `index.html`

Note that in this case, the documents are indexed in the browser after the page is openened. Keep an eye on the console to see when indexing completes. It is also possible to simply replicate an index into the browser (demo coming soon...)
