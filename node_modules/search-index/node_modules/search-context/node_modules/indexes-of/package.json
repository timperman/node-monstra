When this gets near 100%\nyou can use the other commands.\n\n```\nnpm install npmd -g\nnpmd --sync\n```\n\nYou should leave the `npmd` service running in the background,\nthis will make running other `npmd` commands much faster.\n\nnpmd will pull down npm metadata, and store it in a leveldb.\nthis will be less than 200mb, including a full text index.\n\n## install\n\ninstall a module. if the module's dependencies are in the cache,\nthen `npmd` will install without making a single network round trip!\n\n```\nnpmd install browserify --greedy\n```\n\n`--greedy` is optional, if enabled, the dependency tree is flattened as much as possible.\nso you have less duplication.\n\n## publish\n\npublish a module locally. In a package directory, just do:\n\n```\nnpmd publish\n```\n\nand your package version will be stashed into a queue for local use. You can\n`npmd install yourpkg` locally even if `yourpkg` isn't on the public npm yet.\nYou can even have multiple versions of your package queued up locally.\n\nTo inspect your local package queue, do:\n\n```\nnpmd queue\n```\n\nYou can remove a package from your queue with:\n\n```\nnpmd queue rm pkgname@version\n```\n\nTo sync your local package queue with the public npm, you can run:\n\n```\nnpmd queue sync\n```\n\n## resolve\n\nresolve all module versions required to install a given module.\nwill write json to stdout in the same format as npm-shrinkwrap. \n\n```\nnpmd resolve request\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
